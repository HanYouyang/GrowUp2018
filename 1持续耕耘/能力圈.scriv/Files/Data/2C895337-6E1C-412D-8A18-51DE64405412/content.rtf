Elasticity is a measure of how sensitive one variable is in relation to another. It is used to test the effect that changes in price and income have on supply and demand.\cb1 \
\cb3 The concept of price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of changes in quantity demanded to price changes of a given product. Goods that have a price elasticity of less than 1 are said to be inelastic, while those with price elasticity greater than 1 are said to be elastic. Necessities like water are considered inelastic since demand for them remains largely the same, even when their price increases dramatically. Similarly, income elasticity of demand relates changes in demand to changes in income.}
