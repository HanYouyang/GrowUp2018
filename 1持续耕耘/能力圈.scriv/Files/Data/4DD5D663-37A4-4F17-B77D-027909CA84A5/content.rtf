\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs55\fsmilli27648 \cf2 \cb3 Upon hearing the term \'93Pavlovian,\'94 almost everyone thinks of the famous experiment by Ivan Pavlov in which a dog was conditioned to expect food when a bell was rung. Eventually, the dog started salivating as soon as the bell rang, even if no food was present.\cb1 \
\cb3 From birth, all animals and humans are equipped with a limited set of reflexes (i.e., genetically hard-wired responses to specific environmental stimuli). A reflex is the relationship between a specific environmental event or stimulus and a fixed behavioral action or response evoked by that stimulus. Because these reflexes are often critical to survival, they can affect our decision making fundamentally, often without our awareness.\cb1 \

\i\fs71\fsmilli35712 \cf2 \cb3 How it relates to investing
\i0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs55\fsmilli27648 \cf2 \cb3 It\'92s not so surprising, then, to learn that investor behavior is often more instinctual than it initially appears. As we have already seen, one of our most basic tendencies is to \'93fit in\'94 with our social group. This is one type of conditioned behavior focus investors must learn to avoid. Even though a majority of people utilize certain market strategies, it doesn\'92t mean these approaches are necessarily the right ones. Understanding the basic concepts of Pavlovian conditioning can help you resist these potentially destructive behaviors.\cb1 \
\
\
\
\cb3 Pavlovian association is broken down into three basic classes: classical, instrumental and operant conditioning. Let\'92s have a look at each in greater detail.\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\i\fs71\fsmilli35712 \cf2 \cb3 Classical conditioning
\i0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs55\fsmilli27648 \cf2 \cb3 Classic conditioning is when a repeated stimulus elicits the same conditioned emotional response over time. For example, imagine past visits to your grandmother\'92s home where it always seemed to reek of mothballs. Now every time you smell mothballs you recall visiting your grandma; this is one example of classical conditioning.\cb1 \
\cb3 This closely relates to the concept of association. When you watch a Coca-Cola commercial, do you ever see the people drinking Coke 
\i not
\i0  having a good time? Of course not! In its ad campaigns the soft-drink company deliberately (and successfully!) associates drinking Coca-Cola with good times and being happy.\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\i\fs71\fsmilli35712 \cf2 \cb3 Instrumental conditioning
\i0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs55\fsmilli27648 \cf2 \cb3 Instrumental conditioning occurs when a behavior either is continued or discontinued as a result of positive or negative reinforcement received. Trademarks that have developed a positive image tend to generate positive thoughts among current and prospective consumers, which in turn create future sales opportunities.\cb1 \
\cb3 The sheer strength of Pavlovian association is revealed when sales of a product increase even when it is priced higher than comparable products. One reason for this increase in sales is that most people associate higher prices with higher quality. Tiffany, for example, uses its brand appeal to price its products much higher than comparable products that lack the prestigious brand name.\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\i\fs71\fsmilli35712 \cf2 \cb3 Operant conditioning
\i0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs55\fsmilli27648 \cf2 \cb3 Operant conditioning involves associative learning, in which there is a correlation between the response and the presentation of the reinforcer, or reward. This concept was introduced in the classic experiments by B. F. Skinner in which he trained rats and pigeons to press a lever in order to obtain a food reward. His experiments proved that behavior can be modified through the use of rewards.\cb1 \
\
\
\
\cb3 Charlie Munger gives a powerful example of how a reward system can influence behavior when he discusses Xerox:\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 Early in the history of Xerox, Joe Wilson, who was then in the government, had to go back to Xerox because he couldn\'92t understand how their better, new machine was selling so poorly in relation to their older and inferior machine. Of course when he got there he found out that the commission arrangement with the salesmen gave a tremendous incentive to the inferior machine.
