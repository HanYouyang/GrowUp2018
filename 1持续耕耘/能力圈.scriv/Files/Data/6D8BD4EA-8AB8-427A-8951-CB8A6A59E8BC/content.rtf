\f0\fs26 \cf0 Physics is a multidisciplinary science that investigates how the universe functions. In a classic example of combined mental frameworks, Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most famous physicists in history, explained the properties of gravity using two earlier discoveries. Formulating his thoughts on the properties of gravity, he combined the laws of planetary motion with the observation that a falling mass accelerates at a uniform rate.\
Let\'92s take a look at three physics theories that, applied to investing, can provide an effective combined mental framework for investment analysis.}
