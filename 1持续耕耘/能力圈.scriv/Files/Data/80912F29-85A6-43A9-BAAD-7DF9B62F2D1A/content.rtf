\f0\fs26 \cf0 The advantages that economies of scale bring to businesses are extremely important to most companies. One need look no farther than Gillette or Coca-Cola to see the benefits of a large, dependable manufacturing division, coupled with an efficient distribution system. Gillette has an approximate 70% share of the global wet shaving market. It would not have been able to achieve this level of dominance without an efficient manufacturing process and the ability to ship its products globally on an affordable basis. As was stated earlier about Coca-Cola, any company trying to match Gillette would have to spend billions of dollars to match its economies of scale.}
