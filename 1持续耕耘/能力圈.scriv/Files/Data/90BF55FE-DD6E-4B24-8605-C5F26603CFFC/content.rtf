\f0\fs26 \cf0 Statistics is the science of getting answers from available numerical data. Data from a smaller sample population are collected, organized and analyzed to give insight into the characteristics of the population as a whole. Surveys and opinion polls are great examples of statistics in action. The results of polls can affect government policy, product design, market volatility and much, much more. Numbers can even mean the difference between life and death! The DNA-matching programs used by the justice system to convict or acquit defendants are based on statistical models.}
