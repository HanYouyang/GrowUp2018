### How did we get started?

Among the things we’ve learned: if you want a satisfying career, “follow your passion” can be **misleading** advice; you might be able to do more good as an accountant than a charity worker; and that many approaches to making the world a better place don’t work. We’ve also come up with new ways to approach age-old questions like how to figure out what you’re good at, and how to be more successful.

### What you’ll learn

The first six articles discuss **which options will be most fulfilling and have the highest-impact over the long-term**:

1.What makes for a dream job?

4.How to choose which problems to focus on.
5.What are the world’s biggest and most urgent problems?
