## 1What makes for a dream job?

### Two overrated goals for a fulfilling career
People often imagine that a dream job is well paid and easy.

### Money makes you happier, but only a little
Finally, \$ **75,000** of household income is equivalent to an individual income of only \$ **40,000** if you don’t have kids.

To customize these thresholds for yourself, make the following adjustments:

1. Add **$20,000** per dependent who does not work that you fully support.
2. Add 50% if you live in an expensive city, or subtract 30% if you live somewhere cheap.
3. Add more if you’re especially motivated by money (or subtract some if you have frugal tastes).
4. Add 15% in order to be able to save for retirement (or however much you personally need to save in order to be able to maintain the standard of living described above).

The average college graduate in the United States earns \$**68,000** per year over his or her life, while the average Ivy League graduate earns over \$**100,000**. The upshot is that if you’re a college graduate in the US (or a similar country), you’ll likely end up well into the range where more income has almost no effect on your happiness. 


### Don’t aim for low stress

One puzzle is that studies of high-ranking government and military leaders found they had **lower** levels of stress hormones and less anxiety, despite sleeping fewer hours, managing more people and having greater demands placed on them.

One widely supported explanation is that **having a greater sense of control** – by setting their own schedules and determining how to tackle the challenges they face – protects them against the demands of the position.

Instead of seeking to avoid stress, seek out a supportive context and meaningful work, and then challenge yourself.


### What *should* you aim for in a dream job?

>**Positive emotion** – feeling happy day-to-day.
>**Engagement** – having challenging, absorbing tasks.
>**Relationships** – having supportive friends and family.
>**Meaning** – having a purpose higher than yourself.
>**Achievement** – being good at something.

**1.Work that’s engaging**

What really matters is not your salary, status, type of company and so on, but rather, what you do day-by-day, hour-by-hour.

What makes the difference? Why are computer games engaging while office admin isn’t? Researchers have identified four factors:

>The **freedom** to decide how to perform your work.
>**Clear tasks**, with a clearly defined start and end.
>**Variety** in the types of task.
>**Feedback**, so you know how well you’re doing.

Each of these factors has been shown to correlate with job satisfaction in a major meta-analysis (r=0.4).

**2.Work that helps others**

People who volunteer are less depressed and healthier. A randomized study showed that performing a random act of kindness makes the giver happier. And a global survey found that people who donate to charity are as satisfied with their lives as those who earn twice as much.

(We’ll explore jobs that really help people in the next chapter, including jobs that help indirectly as well as directly.)

**3.Work you’re good at**
Being good at your work gives you a sense of achievement, one of the five ingredients of life satisfaction mentioned above.

It also gives you the power to negotiate for the other components of a fulfilling job, such as the ability to work on meaningful projects, undertake engaging tasks and earn fair pay. If people value your contribution, you can ask for these conditions in return.

For both reasons, **skill** ultimately trumps interest. Even if you love art, if you pursue it as a career but aren’t good at it, you’ll end up doing boring graphic design for companies you don’t care about.


**4.Work with supportive colleagues**

Since good relationships are such an important part of having a fulfilling life, it’s important to be able to become friends with at least a couple of people at work. And this probably means working with at least a few people who are similar to you.

In fact, people who are disagreeable and different from yourself can be the people who’ll give you the most useful feedback, provided they care about your interests. 

**5.Lack of major negatives**

To be satisfied, everything above is important. But you also need the absence of things that make work unpleasant. All of the following tend to be linked to job dissatisfaction.

>A long commute, especially if it’s over an hour by bus.
>Very long hours.
>Pay you feel is unfair.
>Job insecurity.

**6.Work that fits with the rest of your life**

You don’t have to get all the ingredients of a fulfilling life from your job. It’s possible to find a job that pays the bills and excel in a side project; or to find a sense of meaning through philanthropy and volunteering; or to build great relationships outside of work.

We’ve advised plenty of people who have done this. There are famous examples too – Einstein had his most productive year in 1905, while working as a clerk at a patent office.

### Should you just follow your passion?

In fact, “following your passion” can make it harder to satisfy the six ingredients, because the areas you’re passionate about are likely to be the most competitive, which makes it harder to find a good job.

Many successful people are passionate, but often their passion developed alongside their success, rather than coming first. Steve Jobs started out passionate about Zen Buddhism. He went into technology as a way to make some quick cash. But as he became successful, his passion grew, until he became the most famous advocate of “doing what you love”.

Rather than having a single passion, in reality our interests change often, and more than we expect. Think back to what you were most interested in five years ago, and you’ll probably find that it’s pretty different from what you’re interested in today. And as we saw above, we’re bad at knowing what really makes us happy.

### Do what contributes to the world

Rather than “follow your passion”, our slogan for a fulfilling career is: get good at something that helps others. Or simply: *do what contributes*.

We highlight “getting good”, because if you find something you’re good at that others value, you’ll have plenty of career opportunities, which gives you the best chance of finding a job with the other ingredients – engaging work, good colleagues, lack of major negatives, and fit with rest of life.
