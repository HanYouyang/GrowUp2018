116 People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things; other people learn by reading about things; others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.
-Doingthings~游泳
1我能更好地观察各个事物的情况作出我自己的准备和反应，比如游泳了解海水还是泳池，深浅，这样自己能够明白该有什么策略，书上不会告诉自己具体的现实情况
2因此我能够理论联系实际，选择更适合一个初学者掌握的泳姿关注简单的动作让我掌握这件事情
3在掌握之后我仍然会选择跟环境中的高级任务交流方法和技巧，这样我可以做得更好，当然读书也可以，但是老手的知识可能还没来得及写在书里

030 It has recently been announced that a new high school may be built in your community. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details in your answer.
这两个题的in实际上是要好好比较和for之间的区别
说这个话是要对上还是对下的思路是不同的
两种写作思路，但是我觉得笑来老师这种把两种AD和DIA分开成为两段的也不错，这也是一种明显的方式
自然地理开头，拥有什么样的环境
交通方便、本地文化传统
坏处都是人产生的，商业带来的各种负外部性，消费、打工




141 If you could make one important change in a school that you attended, what change would you make? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.
请行业人物来进行访谈介绍，了解行业情况
1学生并不了解自己的兴趣，给予他们可以了解之后随便转换自己专业的机会
2让学生更早跟行业大牛进行接触，虽然老师能够提供当下的知识，但是不同程度的行业专家能够给出实践当中各个知识意义的重要性，也能给出行业不同人的选择机会
3有助于不同学生的交流了解，成为一个更加广博的人


135 Some high schools require all students to wear school uniFORMs. Other high schools permit students to decide what to wear to school. Which of these two school policies do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.
穿校服
1节约时间和金钱
2保持学校纪律风貌
3防止学生受到商业影响
（由于是极端二选一，不能一般说到这就结束）
高中应该让步，避免极端

066 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
？我选择同学
1时间更多，互动更多
2平等对话，互动反思
3知识上家长未必懂

002 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
与上一个一起写类似
可以对这句话不断琢磨改进，让这句话形成合理空间
我的思路是在不同的点上面举反例
1在知识上面，父母并不一定比老师懂得多
2在社会发展上面，很多新的东西父母也不了解
3书籍当中有更多的补充，父母的经验和认识也只是人类诸多认识的一小部分

125 Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? All students should be required to study art and music in secondary school. Use specific reasons to support your answer.
初中阶段，同意
先考虑可行性1时间充裕没问题

没有可能说明两者谁更重要
历史形成民族，塑造认同，文学宽广了解这个世界
科学也是人类历史的一部分，只不过用更加抽象的符号帮助我们理解事物之间本质的关系，数学是头脑训练的工具，也是将来进一步探索科学的基础工具
笑来老师从学科发展和学生发展的角度来看问题。

107 Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.
这种观点，没有好学生坏学生，学生的教育情况应该在个人兴趣和社会需求当中寻求折衷
1如果学力达到，没有其他的障碍应该考虑实现他们的梦想，高等教育有其意义；选择适合的学校，兴趣和财力
2没有差学生，暂时学习成绩的领先，教育应该帮助人而非区分人；学生应该符合学校的录取要求，可以设定学校自己专门的考核方式，何况仅凭成绩录取是不公平的
