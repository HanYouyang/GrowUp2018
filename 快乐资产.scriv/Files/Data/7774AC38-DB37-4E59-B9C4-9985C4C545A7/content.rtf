\f0\fs26 \cf0 This concept relates the frequency of an event with the probability of the event occurring. In theory these two factors approach equality when an infinite number of repetitions are observed. Consequently, theoretical values more closely mirror reality as the number of observations increases.\
Let\'92s examine this concept using a sample consisting of all existing mutual funds, graphing them on a bell curve by performance against a market index\'97say, the S&P 500. With such a large number of mutual funds in the sample, at any given point some funds will dramatically underperform the market and some funds will dramatically outperform the market. These outliers are graphically represented by the tails of the well-known bell curve.\
It is important that focus investors understand that chasing recent outperformance can lead to poor investing results. I understand this sounds counterintuitive, but many studies have shown this to be the case, with results tending to move toward the mean. A 2014 study by S&P Dow Jones Indices found: \'93Out of 687 funds that were in the top quartile as of March 2012, only 3.78% managed to stay there by the end of March 2014.\'9435}
