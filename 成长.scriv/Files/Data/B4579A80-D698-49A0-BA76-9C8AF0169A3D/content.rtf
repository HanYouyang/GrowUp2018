\f0\fs26 \cf0 Regression to the mean is a statistical phenomenon in which exceptionally high or low results tend to be followed by more average results. Galton observed this phenomenon when he planted sweet pea seeds and then calculated the average diameter of 100 seeds produced by each plant. He discovered that the seed diameters tended to \'93regress toward the mean,\'94 meaning that the smaller pea seeds had somewhat larger offspring, and the larger seeds had somewhat smaller offspring.\
A word of caution is in order here for focus investors. Remember that regression to the mean, when applied to the selection of common stocks, is a statistical explanation, not an economic one, which is to say that just because a stock price has increased doesn\'92t necessarily signify it will naturally regress to its mean if the intrinsic value of the company has increased to a new, higher level. This also applies to companies that earn outsized profits because these will result in other firms trying to compete and capture a share of those returns, which eventually drives down the original company\'92s overall returns.}
