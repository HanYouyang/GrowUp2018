$课文12  银行和顾客
177. When anyone opens a current account at a bank, he is lending the bank money, repayment of which he may demand at any time, either in cash or by drawing a cheque in favour of another person.	任何人在银行开一个活期账户，就等于把钱借给了银行。这笔钱他可以随时提取，提取的方式可以是取现金，也可以是开一张以他人为收款人的支票。
178. Primarily, the banker-customer relationship is that of debtor and creditor -- who is which depending on whether the customer's account is in credit or is overdrawn.	银行与储户的关系主要是债务人和债权人的关系。究竟谁是债务人谁是债权人，要看储户是有结余还是透支。
179. But, in addition to that basically simple concept, the bank and its customer owe a large number of obligations to one another.	除了这一基本的简单的概念外，银行和储户彼此还需承担大量义务。
180. Many of these obligations can give in to problems and complications but a bank customer, unlike, say, a buyer of goods, cannot complain that the law is loaded against him.	其中许多义务往往引起问题和纠纷。但是储户不能像货物的买主那样来抱怨法律对自己不利。
181. The bank must obey its customer's instructions, and not those of anyone else.	银行必须遵照储户的嘱托办事，不能听从其他人的指令。
182. When, for example, a customer first opens an account, he instructs the bank to debit his account only in respect of cheques draw by himself.	比如，储户首次在银行开户时，嘱咐银行他的存款只能凭本世人签字的支票来提取。
183. He gives the bank specimens of his signature, and there is a very firm rule that the bank has no right or authority to pay out a customer's money on a cheques on which its customer's signature has been forged.	他把自己签名的样本交给银行，对此有一条非常严格的规定：银行没有任何权利或理由把储户的钱让伪造储户的支票取走。
184. It makes no difference that the forgery may have been a very skilful one: the bank must recognize its customer's signature.	即使伪造得很巧妙，也不能付款，因为银行有责任辨认出其储户的签名。
185. For this reason there is no risk to the customer in the practice, adopted by banks, of printing the customer's name on his cheques.	因此，某些银行已采用把储户印在支票上的作法。这种做法对储户毫无风险。
186. If this facilitates forgery, it is the bank which will lose, not the customer.	如果因这种作法出现了伪造的话，受损失的将不是储户，而是银行。

189. The holes are only borings, less than a foot in diameter.	这些洞只不过是一些钻孔，直径不到1英尺。
190. My particular experience is largely in oil, and the search for oil has done more to improve deep drilling than any other mining activity.	我是专门搞石油的，寻找石油比其他任何采矿业对改进钻探作的贡献都要大。
191. When is has been decided where we are going to drill, we put up at the surface an oil derrick.	当确定钻孔地点后，我们就在那里竖起一个井架。
192. It has to be tall because it is like a giant block and tackle,	井架必须很高，因为它像一个巨型滑轮组。

194. The geologist needs to know what rocks the drill has reached, so every so often a sample is obtained with a coring bit.	地质学家需要知道钻头已以到达什么样的岩层，因此时常要用芯钻头取样。
195. It cuts a clean cylinder of rock, from which can be seen the strata the drill has been cutting through.	这种钻头能切割一段光滑的圆柱形岩石，从中能看出所钻透的地层。
196. Once we get down to the oil, it usually flows to the surface because great pressure, either from or water, is pushing it.	一旦到达油层，石油就会由于地下巨大的压力流到地面上来，这种巨大的压力来自地下天然气或水。
197. This pressure must be under control, and we control it by means of the mud which we circulate down the drill pipe.	这种压力必须加以控制，我们让泥桨顺着钻杆向下循环，用这种方法来控制压力。
198. We endeavour to avoid the old, romantic idea of a gusher, which wastes oil and gas.	我们尽量避免使用陈旧天真的喷井方法，那样会浪费石油和天然气。

204. The modern weather models work with a grid of points of the order of sixty miles apart,	现代气象模型以一个坐标图来显示，图中每个点大约是间隔60英里。
205. and even so, some starting data has to guessed, since ground stations and satellites cannot see everywhere.	既使是这样，有些开始时的资料也不得不依靠推测，因为地面工作站和卫星不可能看到地球上的每一个地方。
206. But suppose the earth could be covered with sensors spaced one foot apart, rising at one-foot intervals all the way to the top of the atmosphere.	假设地球上可以布满传感器，每个相隔1英尺，并按1英尺的间隔从地面一直排列到大气层的顶端。

210. At noon the spaces between the sensors will hide fluctuations that the computer will not know about, tiny deviations from the average.	正午时分，传感器之间的距离会掩盖计算机无法知道的波动、任何偏平均值的变化。
211. By 12.01, those fluctuations will already have created small errors one foot away.	到12：01时，那些波动就已经会在1英尺远的地方造成偏差。
212. Soon the errors will have multiplied to the ten-foot scale, and so on up to the size of the globe.	很快这种偏差会增加到尺10英的范围，如此等等，一直到全球的范围。
$课文15  工业中的秘密
213. Two factors weigh heavily against the effectiveness of scientific research in industry.	有两个因素严重地妨碍工业中科学研究的效率：
214. One is the general atmosphere of secrecy in which it is carried out,	一是科研工作中普遍存在的保密气氛；
215. the other the lack of freedom of the individual research worker.	二是研究人员缺乏个人自由。
216. In so far as any inquiry is a secret one, it naturally limits all those engaged in carrying it out from effective contact with their fellow scientists either in other countries or in universities,	任何一项研究都涉及到保密，那些从事科研的人员自然受到了限制。他们不能和其他国家、其他大学、
217. or even, often enough, in other departments of the same firm.	甚至往往不能与本公司的其他部门的同行们进行有效的接触。
218. The degree of secrecy naturally varies considerably.	保密程度自然差别很大。
219. Some of the bigger firms are engaged in researches which are of such general and fundamental nature that it is a positive advantage to them not to keep them secret.	某些大公司进行的研究属于一般和基础的研究，因此不保密对他们才有利。
220. Yet a great many processes depending on such research are sought for with complete secrecy until the stage at which patents can be taken out.	然而，依赖这种研究的很多工艺程序是在完全保密的情况下进行的，直到可以取得专利权的阶段为止。
221. Even more processes are never patented at all but kept as secret processes.	更多的工艺过程根本就不会取得专利权，而是作为秘方保存着。
222. This applies particularly to chemical industries, where chance discoveries play a much larger part than they do in physical and mechanical industries.	在这化学工业方面尤为突出。同物理和机械工业相比，化学工业中偶然发现的机会要多得多。
223. Sometimes the secrecy goes to such an extent that the whole nature of the research cannot be mentioned.	有时，保密竟达到了这样的程度，即连研究工作的整个性质都不准提及。
224. Many firms, for instance, have great difficulty in obtaining technical or scientific books from libraries because they are unwilling to have names entered as having taken out such and such a book,	比如，很多公司向图书馆借阅科技书籍时感到困难，因为它们不愿让人家记下它们公司的名字和借阅的某一本书。

324. In fact, it would be an assistance to all carnivores	因此，任何食肉动物有了毒液，都能从中获益。
325. though it would be a two-edged weapon when they fought each other.	不过，当它们相互撕打时，毒液就成了利弊参半的武器，可以杀死对方，也可以被对方的毒液杀死。
326. But, of the vertebrates, unpredictable Nature selected only snakes (and one lizard).	然而，在脊椎动物中，大自然神秘模测地只选择了蛇（还有一种蜥蜴），
327. One wonders saliva into why Nature, with respect from that of others, as other on the blood.	人们弄不清楚大自然为什么在某些蛇的身上调制出如此高效的毒液来。
328. In the conversion of saliva into poison, one might suppose that a fixed process took place.	人们可能认为，唾液转变成毒液，其中有固定的程序。
329. It did not;	其实没有。

341. that the blood poison is, so to speak, a newer product from an improved formula.	而溶血性毒液，打个比方说，是根据改良配方生产的一种较新的产品。
342. Be that as it may, the nerve poison does its business with man far more quickly than the blood poison.	不过，神经毒辣液比溶血性毒液在人身上起作用快得多。
343. This, however, means nothing.	但是，这没有什么关系，
344. Snakes did not acquire their poison for use against man	因为蛇有毒液不是用来对付人的，
345. but for use against prey such as rats and mice,	而是对付它的猎物，诸如鼠类，

525. In 1953, a former electronics engineer in his fifties, Christopher Cockerell,	1953年，有一位50多岁名叫克里斯托弗.科克雷的原电子工程师，
526. who had turned to boat-building on the Norfolk Broads,	改行在诺福克郡的湖泊地区从事造船业，
527. suggested an idea on which he had been working for many years to the British Government and industrial circles.	他向英国政府和工业界提出了他研究多年的一项计划。
528. It was the idea of supporting a craft on a 'pad', or cushion, of low-pressure air, ringed with a curtain of higher pressure air.	他的设想是：用一个低压空气或软垫来支撑船体，软垫周围用高压空气环绕。
529. Ever since, people have had difficulty in deciding whether the craft should be ranged among ships, planes, or land vehicles -- for it is something in between a boat and an aircraft.	自那以后，人们很难决定是否应该将这种运载工具列为轮船、飞机，或是陆上交通工具，因为它是介于船和飞机之间。
530. As a shipbuilder, Cockerell was trying to find a solution to the problem of the wave resistance which wastes a good deal of a surface ship's power and limits its speed.	作为一个船舶技师，科克雷尔在寻找解决波浪阻力的方法，因为波浪阻力浪费掉了船在水面行驶的大量动力，从而限制了船的速度。
531. His answer was to lift the vessel out of the water by a great number of ring-shaped air jets on the bottom of the craft.	他的解决办法是把船体提离水面，让船在一个气垫上行驶，气垫只有一两英尺厚。船底装上大量环状喷气嘴以实现这一目的。
532. It 'flies', therefore, but it cannot fly higher -- its action depends on the surface, water or ground, over which it rides.	这样，船就能飞了，但飞不高。它的飞行限决于它所悬浮的水面或地面。
533. The first tests on the Solent in 1959 caused a sensation.	1959年，在苏伦特海峡进行的首次试航引起了轰动，
534. The hovercraft travelled first over the water, then mounted the beach, climbed up the dunes, and sat down on a road.	气垫船先是在水面上行驶，后又登上海岸，爬上沙丘，最后停在路上。
535. Later it crossed the Channel, riding smoothly over the waves, which presented no problem.	后来气垫船跨越英吉利海峡，平衡地在波浪上方行驶，波浪不再产生阻力。
536. Since that time, various types of hovercraft have appeared and taken up regular service.	从那以后，各种各样的气垫船出现了，并开始了定期航行服务。
537. The hovercraft is particularly useful in large areas with poor communications such as Africa or Australia;	气垫船在非洲、澳大利亚等交通不发达地区特别有用。
538. it can become a 'flying fruit-bowl', carrying bananas from the plantations to the ports;	它能成为“飞行水果盘子”，把香蕉从种植园动到港口。
539. giant hovercraft liners could span the Atlantic;	大型的气垫班轮或许能跨越大西洋。
540. and the railway of the future may well be the 'hovertrain',	未来的火车或许能成为“气垫火车”，
541. riding on its air cushion over a single rail, which it never touches, at speeds up to 300 m.p.h.	靠气垫在单轨上行驶而不接触轨道，时速可达每小时300英里。
$课文30  海底勘探
542. Our knowledge of the oceans a hundred years ago was confined to the two-dimensional shape of the sea surface and the hazards of navigation presented by the irregularities in depth of the shallow water close to the land.	100年前，我们只知道海洋是二维平面形的，以及靠近陆地浅水区的深浅不一能给航行带来危险。
543. The open sea was deep and mysterious, and anyone who gave more than a passing thought to the bottom confines of the oceans probably assumed that the sea bad was flat.	无边无际的海洋深邃而又神秘，凡是稍稍想过大海海底的人大概都会认为海底是平坦的。
544. Sir James Clark Ross had obtained a sounding of over 2,400 fathoms in 1839, but it was not until of deep soundings was obtained in the Atlantic and the first samples were collected by dredging the bottom.	1839年，詹姆斯.克拉克.罗斯爵士曾测得海水深度超过2，400英寻；但直到1869年，皇家学会用英国“豪猪”号舰艇进行了几次巡航后，才在大西洋测得一个海水深度，同时能过挖掘海底，取得了研究海底的首批样品。
545. Shortly after this the famous H. M. S. Challenger expedition established the study of the sea-floor as a subject worthy of the most qualified physicists and geologists.	此后不久，英国著名的“挑战者”号舰艇对海底的那次考察，把对海床的研究确立为一个值得一流物理学家和地质学家从事的研究课题，
546. A burst of activity associated with the laying of submarine cables soon confirmed the challenger's observation that many parts of the ocean were two to there miles deep,	铺设海底电缆的热潮很快证实了“挑战者”号的观察结果：海洋中很多地方可深达两三英里，
547. and the existence of underwater features of considerable magnitude.	水下特征差异极大。
548. Today, enough soundings are available to enable a relief map of the Atlantic to be drawn and we know something of the great variety of the sea bed's topography.	现在已有足够的水深测量数据来绘制一张大西洋洋底地形图，而且我对海底地形的千变万化也有了一定的了解。
549. Since the sea covers the greater part of the earth's surface,	既然海洋覆盖着地球的大部分表面，
550. it is quite reasonable to regard the sea floor as the basic form of the crust of the earth, with, superimposed upon, it the continents, together with the islands and other features of the oceans.	因此完全有理由把海床看作地壳的基本模壳，上面附加着大陆以及岛屿和海洋的其他形态。
551. The continents form rugged tablelands which stand nearly three miles above the floor of the open ocean.	大陆是崎岖不平的高地，高出辽阔的海洋海底近三英里。
552. From the shore line, out a distance which may be anywhere from a few miles to a few hundred miles, runs the gentle slope of the continental shelf, geologically part of the continents.	从海岸线向大海延伸几英里到几百英里的区域是大陆架慢坡，从地质学上来说，它是大陆的一部分。
553. The real dividing line between continents and oceans occurs at the foot a steeper slope.	大陆和海洋的真正分界线是在陡破脚下。
554. This continental slope usually starts at a place somewhere near the 100-fatheom mark and in the course of a few hundred miles reaches the true ocean floor at 2,500-3,500 fathoms.	大陆架慢坡一般是从差不多100英寻水深的地方开始的，一直延伸到几百英里远深达2，500至3，500的地方，那里才是真正的海底。
555. The slope averages about 1 in 30.	坡度平均约为1/30，
556. but contains steep, probably vertical, cliffs, and gentle sediment-covered terraces,	但其中包括陡峭的、乃至垂直的峭壁和沉积物覆盖的缓和的阶梯地带，
557. and near its lower reaches there is a long tailing-off which is almost certainly the result of material transported out to deep water after being eroded from the continental masses.	在这个地带的低处是很长的一段尾沙地段，基本上可以断定这个地段是大陆块体上侵蚀下来的物质被水冲到深水处形成的。
$课文31  雕塑家的语言
558. Appreciation of sculpture depends upon the ability to respond to form in there dimension.	对雕塑的鉴赏力取决于对立体的反应能力。
559. That is perhaps why sculpture has been described as the most difficult of all arts;	雕塑被说成是所有艺术中最难的艺术，可能就是这个道理。
560. certainly it is more difficult than the arts which involve appreciation of flat forms, shape in only two dimensions.	欣赏雕塑品当然比欣赏平面的艺术品要难。“
561. Many more people are 'form-blind' than colour-blind.	形盲”的人数比“色盲”的人数要多得多。
562. The child learning to see, first distinguishes only two-dimensional shape;	正在学看东西的儿童起初只会分辨二维形态，
563. it cannot judge distances, depths. Later, for its personal safety and practical needs, it has to develop (partly by means of touch) the ability to judge roughly three-dimensonal distances.	不会判断距离和深度。慢慢地，由于自身安全和实际需要，儿童必须发展（部分通过触觉）粗略判断三维空间距离的能力。
564. But having satisfied the requirements of practical necessity, most people go no further.	但是。大部分人在满足了实际需要后，就不再继续发展这种能力了。
565. Though they may attain considerable accuracy in the perception of flat form,	虽然他们对平面形的感觉能达到相当准确的程度，
566. they do not make the further intellectual and emotional effort needed to comprehend form in its full spatial existence.	但他们没有在智力和感情上进一步努力去理解存在于空间的整个形态。
567. This is what the sculptor must do. He must strive continually to think of, and use, form in its full spatial completeness.	而雕塑家就必须做到这一点。他必须勤于想像并且利用形体在空间中的完整性。
568. He gets the solid shape, as it were, inside his head-he thinks of it, whatever its size, as if he were holding it completely enclosed in the hollow of his hand.	可以说，当他想像一个物体时，不管其大小如何，他脑子里得到的是一个立体的概念，就好像完全握在自己手心里一样。
569. He mentally visualizes a complex form from all round itself;	他的大脑能从物体周围的各个角度勾画出其复杂的形象，
570. he knows while he looks at one side what the other side is like,	他看物体的一边时，便知道另一边是个什么样子。
571. he identifies himself with its centre of gravity, its mass, its weight;	他把自身和物体重心、质量、重量融为一体。
572. he realizes its volume, as the space that the shape displaces in the air.	他能意识到物体的体积，那就是它的形状有空气中所占的空间。
573. And the sensitive observer of sculpture must also learn to feel shape simply as shape, not as description or reminiscence.	因此，敏锐的雕塑观赏者也必须学会把形体作为形体来感觉，不要靠描述和印象去想象。
574. He must, for example, perceive an egg as a simple single solid shape, quite apart from its significance as food, or from the literary idea that it will become a bird.	以鸟蛋为例。观赏者必须感觉到它是一个单一的实体形态，而完全不靠它的食用意义或它会变成鸟这样的文字概念来感觉。
575. And so with solids such as a shell, a nut, a plum, a pear, a tadpole, a mushroom, a mountain peak, a kidney, a carrot, a tree-trunk, a bird, a bud, a lark, a ladybird, a bulrush, a bone.	对于其他实体，如，贝壳、核桃、李子、梨子、蝌蚪、蘑菇、山峰、肾脏、胡萝卜、树干、鸟儿、花蕾、云雀、瓢虫、芦苇以及骨头也应这样来感觉。
576. From these he can go on to appreciate more complex forms of combinations of several forms.	从这些形体出发，观赏者可进一步观察更为复杂的形体或若干形体的组合。
$课文32  伽利略的复生
577. In his own lifetime Galileo was the centre of violent controversy;	伽利略在世时是激烈论战的中心。
578. but the scientific dust has long since settled, and today we can see even his famous clash with the Inquisition in something like its proper perspective.	但是，自他逝世以来，那场科学上的纷争早已平息了下来，甚至他和宗教法庭的著名冲突，我们今天也能正确如实地看待。
579. But, in contrast, it is only in modern times that Galileo has become a problem child for historians of science.	但是相比之下，对于科学史家来说，伽利略只是在现代才变成了一个新的难题。
580. The old view of Galileo was delightfully uncomplicated.	令人高兴的是，过去对伽利略的看法并不复杂。
581. He was, above all, a man who experimented:	他首先是个实验工作者，
582. who despised the prejudices and book learning of the Aristotelians,	他蔑视亚里士多德学派的偏见和空洞的书本知识。
583. who put his questions to nature instead of to the ancients, and who drew his conclusions fearlessly.	他向自然界而不是向古人提出问题，并大胆地得出结论。
584. He had been the first to turn a telescope to the sky, and he had seen there evidence enough to overthrow Aristotle and Ptolemy together.	他是第一个把望远镜对准天空的人，观察到的论据足以把亚里士多德和托勒密一起推翻。
585. He was the man who climbed the Leaning Tower of Pisa and dropped various weights from the top,	他就是那个曾经爬上比萨斜塔，从塔顶向下抛掷积各种重物的人；
586. who rolled balls down inclined planes, and then generalized the results of his many experiments into the famous law of free fall.	他是那个使地球体沿斜面向下滚动，然后将多次实验结果概括成著名的自由落体定律的人。
587. But a closer study of the evidence, supported by a deeper sense of the period, and particularly by a new consciousness of the philosophical undercurrents in the scientific revolution, has profoundly modified this view of Galileo.	但是，对那个时代的深化了解，尤其是以科学家革命中哲学潜流的新意识为依据，进一步仔细研究，就会极大地改变对伽利略的看法。
588. Today, although the old Galileo lives on in many popular writings, among historians of science a new and more sophisticated picture has emerged.	今天，虽然已故的伽利略继续活在许多通俗读物中，但在科学史家中间，一个新的更加复杂的伽利略形象出现了。
589. At the same time our sympathy fro Galileo's opponents as grown somewhat.	与此同时，我们对伽利略的反对派的同情也有所增加。
590. His telescopic observations are justly immortal;	伽利略用望远镜所作的观察确实是不朽的，
591. they aroused great interest at the time, they had important theoretical consequences, and they provided a striking demonstration of the potentialities hidden in instruments and apparatus.	这些观察当时引起人们极大的兴趣，具有重要的理论意义，并充分显示出了仪表和仪器的潜在力量。
592. But can we blame those who looked and failed to see what Galileo saw, if we remember that to use a telescope at the limit of its powers calls for long experience and intimate familiarity with one's instrument?	但是，如果我们想到，便用一架倍数有限的望远镜需要长期的经验和对自己仪器的熟悉程度，那么我们怎么能去责备观察了天空但没有看到伽利略所看到的东西的那些人呢？
593. Was the philosopher who refused to look through Galileo's telescope more culpable than those who alleged that the spiral nebulae observed with Lord Rosse's great telescope in the eighteen-forties were scratches left by the grinder?	某位哲学家曾拒绝使用伽利略的望远镜去观察天空；到了19世纪40年代，有人硬把罗斯勋爵高倍望远镜观测到的螺旋状星云说成是磨镜工留下的磨痕。难道反对伽利略的哲学家比诋毁罗斯勋爵造谣者应受到更大的谴责吗？
594. We can perhaps forgive those who said the moons of Jupiter were produced by Galileo's spyglass if we recall that in his day, as for centuries before, curved glass was the popular contrivance for producing not truth but illusion, untruth;	如果我们回想一下伽利略之前几个世纪期间，曲面镜一直是一种用于产生幻影而不是产生真象的把戏装置，那么我们就会原谅那些当时把伽利略观察到的木星卫生说成是伽利略用他的小望远镜变出来的人们，
595. and if a single curved glass would distort nature, how much more would a pair of them?	何况一片曲面镜就可歪曲自然，那么伽利略的两片曲面镜对自然的歪曲又该多大呢？

599. Education, with its cycles of instruction so carefully worked out, punctuated by textbooks -- those purchasable wells of wisdom-what would civilization be like without its benefits?	教育，以其教学周期如此精心地安排，并以教科书 -- 那些可以买到的智慧源泉 -- 予以强化，如果不受其惠，文明将会是个什么样子呢？
600. So much is certain: that we would have doctors and preachers, lawyers and defendants, marriages and births -- but our spiritual outlook would be different.	至少，这些是可以肯定的：虽然我们还会有医生和牧师、律师和被告、婚姻和生育，但人们的精神面貌将是另一个样子。
601. We would lay less stress on 'facts and figures' and more on a good memory, on applied psychology, and on the capacity of a man to get along with his fellow-citizens.	人们不会重视‘资料和数据’，而靠好记性、实用心理学与同伴相处的能力。
602. If our educational system were fashioned after its bookless past we would have the most democratic form of 'college' imaginable.	如果我们的教育制度仿效没有书籍的古代教育，我们的学院将具有可以想象得出的最民主的形式了。

605. It is the ideal condition of the 'equal start' which only our most progressive forms of modern education try to regain.	这就是我们最进步的现代教育试图恢复的“平等起步”的理想状况。
606. In primitive cultures the obligation to seek and to receive the traditional instruction is binding to all.	在原始文化中，寻求和接受传统教育的义务对全民都有约束力。
607. There are no 'illiterates' -- if the term can be applied to peoples without a script	因而没有“文盲”（如果这个字眼儿可以用于没有文字的民族的话）。
608. while our own compulsory school attendance became law in Germany in 1642, in France in 1806, and in England in 1876,and is still non-existent in a number of 'civilized' nations.	而我们的义务教育成为法律在德国是在1642年，在法国是在1806年，在英国是在1876年。
609. This shows how long it was before we deemed it necessary to make sure that all our children could share in the knowledge accumulated by the 'happy few' during the past centuries.	这说明，经过了多么漫长的时间之后，我们才认识到，有必要确保我们的孩子享有多少个世纪以来由‘少数幸运者’所积累起来的知识。
610. Education in the wilderness is not a matter of monetary means.	荒凉地区的教育不是钱的问题，
611. All are entitled to an equal start.	所有的人都享有平等起步的权利。
612. There is none of the hurry which, in our society, often hampers the full development of a growing personality.	那里没有我们今天社会中的匆忙生活，而匆忙的生活常常妨碍个性的全面发展。
613. There, a child grows up under the ever-present attention of his parent;	荒凉地区的孩子无时无刻不在父母关怀下成长。
