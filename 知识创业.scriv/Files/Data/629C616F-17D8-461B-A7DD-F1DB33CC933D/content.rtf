\f0\fs32 \cf0 IN ALMOST EVERY SPECULATIVE SITUATION throughout history, investors become excessively optimistic about the future, forget to follow the principle of delayed gratification and get overconfident regarding their own investing prowess. This optimism and overconfidence are consistently reinforced in the early stages of any proclaimed \'93new era\'94 in investing. This was readily observable during both the Great Depression and the Internet bubble when the news media were filled with people saying that the market had entered a new Golden Age and using that \'93fact\'94 to justify excessive stock prices. Of course, both time periods ended disastrously for investors who listened to such siren songs.\
This leads us to the conclusion that the most important indicator of investors\'92 success is how well they understand their own psychological makeup and how deep their understanding is of their own ability to cope with the stresses of market fluctuations. Most investors can be taught how to identify and value great companies if they\'92re willing to spend the necessary time and effort. They often run into trouble, however, when they don\'92t avoid the traps of their own mental makeup. To be a successful investor, it\'92s important to identify and understand these pitfalls\'97and how they have impacted your past investment decisions\'97before you can work on solutions to prevent them from affecting your decisions going forward.}
