\f0\fs26 \cf0 In physics, an object is said to be in a state of equilibrium when all forces acting on the object are balanced. Similarly, economists use equilibrium theory to explain how markets are supposed to work. Markets are said to be in equilibrium, or balance, when supply equals demand. Efficient market theory (EMT) finds its root in this concept, since it states that stock prices and their intrinsic values trade in equilibrium. While EMT is incorrect from an investment standpoint, it is fair to say that, for the most part, stocks prices tend to trade around their intrinsic values.\

The market is a complex, adaptive organism in which many intertwining parts continually change behavior patterns in response to changing environmental stimuli. It\'92s also continually processing new information and, as such, can never fully be in a state of equilibrium. For focus investors this means that the market as a whole can present investors with valuations that are significantly higher or lower than a company\'92s real value.}
