\f0\fs26 \cf0 The mean is the most basic statistical concept that investors will encounter. Simply put, it is the sum of a series of quantities divided by the number of quantities in the series. A synonym for mean is average.\
For example, let\'92s calculate the mean salary at a company with the following personnel and salary structure:\
The CEO of the company receives a salary of $100,000 per year.\
Two managers earn $200,000 per year.\
The firm employs two accountants, each of whom earns $45,000 per year.\
The firm\'92s two secretaries both earn $30,000 per year.\
To calculate the mean, first add all the salary amounts together. This equals $650,000. Next, divide this number by the number of salaried personnel, or 7. The mean salary paid by this company is $650,000 divided by 7, or $92,857.\
The mean can prove to be an unreliable measure, however, as any abnormally high or low values can skew the result. Look at the above data set closely, and you will observe that only three out of the seven people earn a salary that approximates the mean. Correcting for this distortion requires two additional statistical tools\'97standard deviation and normal distribution.\
