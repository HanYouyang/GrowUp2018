\f0\fs36 \cf0 0304 \'94Money spent on research is almost always a good investment, even when the results of that research are controversial."\
0305 I agree with the speaker's broad assertion that money spent on research is generally money well invested.\
0306 However, the speaker unnecessarily extends this broad assertion to embrace research whose results are "controversial," while ignoring certain compelling reasons why some types of research might be unjustifiable.\
0307 My points of contention with the speaker involves the fundamental objectives and nature of research, as discussed below.\
\
0308 I concede that the speaker is on the correct philosophical side of this issue.\
0309 After all, research is the exploration of the unknown for true answers to our questions, and for lasting solutions to our enduring problems.\
0310 Research is also the chief means by which we humans attempt to satisfy our insatiable appetite for knowledge, and our craving to understand ourselves and the world around us. \
0311 Yet, in the very notion of research also lies my first point of contention with the speaker, who illogically presumes that we can know the results of research before we invest in it. \
0312 To the contrary, if research is to be of any value it must explore uncharted and unpredictable territory. \
0313 In fact, query whether research whose benefits are immediate and predictable can break any new ground, or whether it can be considered "research" at all.\
\
0314 While we must invest in research irrespective of whether the results might be controversial, at the same time we should be circumspect about research whose objectives are too vague and whose potential benefits are too speculative.\
0315 After all, expensive research always carries significant opportunity costs--in terms of how the money might be spent toward addressing society's more immediate problems that do not require research.\
0316  One apt illustration of this point involves the so-called "Star Wars" defense initiative, championed by the Reagan administration during the 1980s. \
0319 In retrospect, this initiative was ill-conceived and largely a waste of taxpayer dollars; \
0320 and few would dispute that the exorbitant amount of money devoted to the initiative could have gone a long way toward addressing pressing social problems of the day--by establishing after-school programs for delinquent latchkey kids, by enhancing AIDS awareness and education, and so forth.}
