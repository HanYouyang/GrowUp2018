\f0\fs48 \cf0 0304 \'94Money spent on research is almost always a good investment, even when the results of that research are controversial."\
0305 I agree with the speaker's broad assertion that money spent on research is generally money well invested.\
0306 However, the speaker unnecessarily extends this broad assertion to embrace research whose results are "controversial," while ignoring certain compelling reasons why some types of research might be unjustifiable.}
