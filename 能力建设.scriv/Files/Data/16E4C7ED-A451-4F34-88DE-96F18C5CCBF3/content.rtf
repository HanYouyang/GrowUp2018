\f0\fs26 \cf0 In nuclear physics, critical mass is the minimum amount of fissile material necessary to achieve a self-sustaining fission chain reaction. Dramatic shifts in the thinking of large populations generally do not occur at a single moment in time, but rather they develop gradually as a progression, or chain, of events subtly influences people\'92s thinking. As time goes on, these ideas seem to develop more and more momentum, until critical mass is reached, and the new attitude or behavior is adopted by the group.\
In business, this concept can be observed when a company undergoes a fundamental change in operations that leads to a reduction in cost per unit produced. This most often is the result of increased production, realized through a series of improved operational efficiencies.\
These economies of scale can be observed in full force at Coca-Cola. No company could replicate its distribution system, and thus be able to match its pricing, unless that company were willing to spend billions of dollars. The achievement of critical mass usually means the company achieving it holds some type of competitive advantage.}
